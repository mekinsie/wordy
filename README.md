## Installation & Requirements
**Ruby or Docker is required to run this application**

 <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/getting-started-with-ruby/installing-ruby">Ruby download instructions</a>  
 <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/docker-with-ruby/installing-docker">Docker download instructions</a>  
1. Navigate to the desired directory where you would like to clone the project to.

2. Once you have chosen your desired directory, clone the github repo using the version control tool `git` (<a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/git-and-github">download instructions</a>). Typing the following command into your terminal:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mekinsie/wordy
```
3. Open the project in VSCode by typing the following in your terminal:

``` bash
$ code .
```
* Note: VSCode is a code editing software. If you don't already have it, you can download it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>  

**If you are using Docker, skip steps 4 & 5.**

4. While located in the root directy, install gem bundler by typing:

``` bash
$ gem install bundler
```

5. Install gem bundles by typing:

``` bash
$ bundle
```

## Running Tests
* This application was created using test-driven development (TDD).
* To run the tests yourself, follow the steps below. 

**Run tests using Ruby (no Docker):**
If you have Ruby already installed, simply type "rspec" into your terminal while located in the root directory of the project.
``` bash
$ rspec
```

**Run tests using Docker:**

To use Docker, you will first need to [install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) it. Once it's installed, Docker should be open so you can actually run Docker commands in the terminal.

We recommend creating an alias for the following commands. The alias should look something like this:

```
dspec ()
{
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose up --build
  docker-compose run --rm app
}
```
<a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/docker-with-ruby/using-aliases">Instructions on how to create an Alias</a>  
With this alias, the `dspec` command will automatically run RSpec tests. If you prefer not to use an alias, simply type each of the aforementioned commands into your terminal.
